.SH NAME
simple_shell - A Simple Shell Implementation in C for Linux

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B simple_shell
[options] [file]

.SH DESCRIPTION
In UNIX, the term "shell" refers to the interactive user interface with an operating system. The shell is responsible for understanding and executing user-entered commands. In some systems, it is referred to as a command interpreter. A shell provides a command syntax interface.

.SH Overview

The Simple Shell is a command-line program designed to read and interpret command lines from either a file or the terminal. It executes these commands on a Linux operating system. When a user logs into the system, the Simple Shell is initiated. It offers numerous features to enhance interactive use and has the advantage of a common interpretative language for both interactive and non-interactive use (shell scripts). Commands can be entered directly into the running Simple Shell or stored in a file for direct execution.

.SH Return Value

The Simple Shell returns 0 upon successful execution. Any other number indicates a failure.

.SH PATH

The Simple Shell searches for executables in directories specified in the PATH environment variable.

.SH OPTIONS
.B simple_shell
Command options are entered after the main command, followed by a space and a '-' symbol.

.SH EXAMPLE

[command] [options]
$ ls -l

.SH BUGS
A single space is required after an argument.

.SH AUTHOR
The Simple Shell was conceived by Julien Barbier and implemented by Ezekiel Gwamna and Ugo Ogadi as a collaborative project. It was developed as part of the ALX Software Engineering program.
